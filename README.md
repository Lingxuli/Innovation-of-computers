# AI face generation

Over the past quarter-century, humans have become more reliant on social networks, yet strangers on the Internet can be anything and from anywhere. The administrator of a music forum may be a kid living in his mother's basement, the 14-year-old girl in a chat room may be an undercover cop, and the wealthy businesswoman in your mailbox who is begging you for money for a child or an inheritance is instantly known as a fraud. While we've learned not to trust each other's usernames and text introductions, the same cannot be said of photos. We used to believe that it was impossible to make a picture out of thin air, and that the person in a picture had to be a real person. Sure, a scammer could be using someone else's photo, but doing so is a risky strategy, and a reverse lookup using Google image Search will always find the source of the photo. So we tend to trust pictures, and the profile of a business with a picture is obviously more trustworthy, and the picture on a dating site may be much more different than the actual person, but because there is a picture, we can always find out that it must have come from someone. But a new reverse machine learning algorithm breaks that rule by allowing people to quickly create "composite photos" of people who never existed.
