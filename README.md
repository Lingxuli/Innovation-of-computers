# AI face generation

Over the past quarter-century, humans have become more reliant on social networks, yet strangers on the Internet can be anything and from anywhere. The administrator of a music forum may be a kid living in his mother's basement, the 14-year-old girl in a chat room may be an undercover cop, and the wealthy businesswoman in your mailbox who is begging you for money for a child or an inheritance is instantly known as a fraud. While we've learned not to trust each other's usernames and text introductions, the same cannot be said of photos. We used to believe that it was impossible to make a picture out of thin air, and that the person in a picture had to be a real person. Sure, a scammer could be using someone else's photo, but doing so is a risky strategy, and a reverse lookup using Google image Search will always find the source of the photo. So we tend to trust pictures, and the profile of a business with a picture is obviously more trustworthy, and the picture on a dating site may be much more different than the actual person, but because there is a picture, we can always find out that it must have come from someone. But a new reverse machine learning algorithm breaks that rule by allowing people to quickly create "composite photos" of people who never existed.

# Is the Internet safe when human faces can be synthesized?

While compositing photos of faces is cool, it has caused some consternation. As we all know, conversational robots have partially replaced the customer service work, and many banks and businesses have used AI for customer service. Even the characters in the video can use Deepfakes to "change their faces". Although artificial intelligence has greatly facilitated our lives, we have to pay attention to the security risks it brings. Facial recognition is by far the most popular AI technology available, and it's not clear that such systems can be fooled by techniques such as face-swapping, but their existence is fraught with uncertainty.
